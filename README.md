# nthugdc.github.io
Homepage for NTHUGDC

## About
This homepage is set up using the npm package `create-react-app`, with the TypeScript template.

## For content uploaders

Use the [Sanity Studio dashboard](nthugdc.sanity.studio) make posts.

## For developers

The site's React files are in the `app` folder, except for the `app/nthugdcwebsite` folder, which contains files for deploying the Sanity Studio dashboard. This means you'll have to enter `npm install` for the two folders separately, if you want to work on both.
